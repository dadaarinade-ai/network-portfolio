MITRE ATT&CK Cheat Sheet (SOC Analyst L1)

What is MITRE ATT&CK?

MITRE ATT&CK is a globally used framework that documents real-world attacker behaviors.
It helps security teams detect, investigate, and respond to cyber attacks by mapping observed activities to known attacker tactics and techniques.


---

Core Concepts

Tactic → Why the attacker is performing an action (goal)

Technique → How the attacker achieves that goal

Sub-technique → Specific implementation of a technique

MITRE ATT&CK Tactics Overview

1. Reconnaissance

Goal: Gather information about the target
Examples:

Network scanning

Identifying users, services, and public assets



---

2. Resource Development

Goal: Prepare attack infrastructure
Examples:

Creating phishing domains

Acquiring malware tools



---

3. Initial Access

Goal: Gain entry into the system
Common Techniques:

Phishing

Exploiting public-facing applications

Valid account abuse



---

4. Execution

Goal: Run malicious code
Common Techniques:

PowerShell execution

Command-line execution

Scheduled tasks



---

5. Persistence

Goal: Maintain access after reboot or logout
Common Techniques:

Registry run keys

Startup folder abuse

Creating new user accounts



---

6. Privilege Escalation

Goal: Gain higher-level permissions
Common Techniques:

Exploiting misconfigurations

Token impersonation

Abuse of admin privileges



---

7. Defense Evasion

Goal: Avoid detection by security controls
Common Techniques:

Disabling antivirus

Obfuscated scripts

Clearing event logs



---

8. Credential Access

Goal: Steal usernames and passwords
Common Techniques:

Credential dumping

Keylogging

LSASS memory access



---

9. Discovery

Goal: Understand the environment
Common Techniques:

Network discovery

Account discovery

Service enumeration



---
10. Lateral Movement

Goal: Move to other systems in the network
Common Techniques:

Pass-the-Hash

Remote services (SMB, RDP)



---

11. Collection

Goal: Gather sensitive data
Common Techniques:

Screen capture

File search

Email collection



---

12. Command and Control (C2)

Goal: Communicate with attacker-controlled servers
Common Techniques:

HTTP/HTTPS beaconing

DNS tunneling



---

13. Exfiltration

Goal: Send stolen data out of the network
Common Techniques:

Exfiltration over C2 channel

Cloud storage abuse



---

14. Impact

Goal: Disrupt, damage, or extort
Common Techniques:

Data encryption (ransomware)

Data destruction

Account lockout



---

MITRE ATT&CK in SOC Operations

How SOC Analysts Use MITRE ATT&CK:-

-Map SIEM alerts to attacker techniques

-Understand attacker intent and stage

-Prioritize incidents based on attack progression

Improve detection and threat hunting



---

Example Alert Mapping

Activity Observed	MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

Suspicious email attachment	Initial Access – Phishing
PowerShell spawned silently	Execution – PowerShell
Defender service disabled	Defense Evasion
Credentials dumped	Credential Access
Data sent externally	Exfiltration



---

Why MITRE ATT&CK Matters

Standardizes threat detection language

Improves incident response clarity

Helps predict attacker next steps

Widely used by SOC teams, SIEMs, and EDR tools



---

Summary

> MITRE ATT&CK provides a structured way to understand, detect, and respond to cyber attacks by mapping observed activity to real-world attacker tactics and techniques.
