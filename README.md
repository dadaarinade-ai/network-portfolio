# Network Security Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my Network Security Analyst Portfolio.  
This repository contains a collection of hands-on projects and exercises that demonstrate my progress in network security, threat detection, and network monitoring.  
It showcases my ability to apply practical tools and techniques in real-world security analysis.

---

## Portfolio Structure

| Folder | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **Firewall** | Covers firewall fundamentals, including traffic filtering concepts, firewall types, rule creation, and basic packet-filtering behavior in a network. |
| **IDS_project** | Focuses on Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), including how IDS tools like Snort works, alert generation, and detection of suspicious network activities.|
| **Linux CLI** | Lean into Linux command-line fundamentals for security analysis, including file navigation, process monitoring, log analysis, and basic networking commands.|
| **Projects-splunk-siem** | Focuses on ingesting logs into Splunk, creating dashboards, searching security events, and analyzing alerts in a SIEM environment.|
| **Sysmon** | Covers Sysmon installation and configuration, monitoring detailed Windows endpoint activity such as process creation, network connections, and file changes.|
| **Windows event viewer** | Focuses on analyzing Windows logs (Security, System, Application), understanding Event IDs, and detecting suspicious authentication and system activities.|
| **Wireshark-Mastery** |  Focus on packet capture and traffic analysis using Wireshark, including protocol analysis, filtering, and identifying malicious network behavior.|
| **nmap** |  Focuses on network scanning using Nmap, including host discovery, port scanning, service/version detection, and basic vulnerability identification.|
| **reports** |  Contains written reports documenting findings, analysis, screenshots, and conclusions from labs, projects, and security investigations.|
| **MITRE ATTACK** | Focuses on mapping observed attacker behaviors and techniques to the MITRE ATT&CK framework for structured threat analysis and reporting.|

## Tools and Technologies

- Nmap (network scanning and auditing)  
- Wireshark (packet capture and analysis)
- Splunk (collecting, analysing and monitor data for security threats)
- Firewalls (traffic filtering and rule configuration)
- Snort(detect and prevent network intrusion)
- Git and GitHub (version control and collaboration)  
- Markdown and Word (reporting and documentation)
  

---

## Sample Deliverables

This portfolio includes examples of:
- Nmap scan reports  
- Wireshark capture results  
- Firewall rule configurations
- Spluck
- Snort
- Project documentation and summaries

---
## Simulation Note

The Snort IDS rules for detecting ICMP ping and HTTP GET requests were developed and tested in a Windows environment. While full live execution on Windows was limited, the expected alerts are shown in the simulated output. I am committed to mastering this setup and will deploy and validate these rules fully on a Linux environment in the near future.

## Learning Objectives

Through this portfolio, I aim to:
- Strengthen my understanding of network security principles  
- Apply practical tools to detect and prevent network threats  
- Improve my documentation and analytical reporting skills  
- Build experience suitable for junior-level network security roles

## Certifications 
- Certified Cybersecurity Educator professional(CCEP)
- Introduction to Cybersecurity (Cisco)
- Endpoint Security (Cisco)
- Networking Basics (Cisco)
- Networking Devices and initial Configuration (Cisco)
- Network Defense (Cisco)
- Cyber Threat Management (Cisco)
