# Network Security Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my Network Security Analyst Portfolio.  
This repository contains a collection of hands-on projects and exercises that demonstrate my progress in network security, threat detection, and network monitoring.  
It showcases my ability to apply practical tools and techniques in real-world security analysis.
