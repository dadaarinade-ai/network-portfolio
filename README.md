# Network Security Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my Network Security Analyst Portfolio.  
This repository contains a collection of hands-on projects and exercises that demonstrate my progress in network security, threat detection, and network monitoring.  
It showcases my ability to apply practical tools and techniques in real-world security analysis.

## Portfolio Structure

| Folder | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **Day1_Intro-to-Networks** | Covers the basics of networking, IP addressing, and subnetting. |
| **Day2_OSI-Network-Scanning** | Introduces the OSI model and practical network scanning concepts. |
| **Day3_Nmap-Scan** | Focuses on host discovery and service enumeration using Nmap. |
| **Day4_Nmap-Analysis** | Analyzes scan results, open ports, and potential vulnerabilities. |
| **Day5_6_Firewall-Wireshark** | Involves firewall configuration, rule testing, and packet analysis using Wireshark. |
| **IDS_Project** | creating snort ids rules to detect ICMP ping and HTTP GET requests, simulating real-world network intrustion alerts
| **Projects** | Contains completed reports and documentation from all stages of the portfolio. |

## Tools and Technologies

- Nmap (network scanning and auditing)  
- Wireshark (packet capture and analysis)
- Splunk (collecting, analysing and monitor data for security threats)
- Firewalls (traffic filtering and rule configuration)
- Snort(detect and prevent network intrusion)
- Git and GitHub (version control and collaboration)  
- Markdown and Word (reporting and documentation)

---

## Sample Deliverables

This portfolio includes examples of:
- Nmap scan reports  
- Wireshark capture results  
- Firewall rule configurations
- Spluck
- Snort
- Project documentation and summaries

---
## Simulation Note

The Snort IDS rules for detecting ICMP ping and HTTP GET requests were developed and tested in a Windows environment. While full live execution on Windows was limited, the expected alerts are shown in the simulated output. I am committed to mastering this setup and will deploy and validate these rules fully on a Linux environment in the near future.
