## Linux Command-Line Fundamentals (SOC & Network Security Focus)

This section documents my hands-on learning of essential Linux commands commonly used by SOC Analysts, Network Security Analysts, and system administrators. These commands are fundamental for log analysis, file handling, system navigation, and incident investigation in Linux-based environments.

---

### **1. `echo`**

**Purpose:** Displays text or variables to the terminal. Commonly used for quick messages, scripting, and writing data into files.

**Example:**

```bash
echo "SOC Analyst in training"
```

Appending text to a file:

```bash
echo "Failed login from 192.168.1.10" >> logs.txt
```

---

### **2. `wc` (Word Count)**

**Purpose:** Counts lines, words, and bytes in a file. Very useful for analyzing log file size and activity volume.

**Examples:**

```bash
wc access.log
```

Counts lines, words, and bytes.

```bash
wc -l access.log
```

Counts only the number of lines (commonly used in SOC log analysis).

---

### **3. `sort`**

**Purpose:** Sorts lines of text alphabetically or numerically. Useful for organizing IP addresses, usernames, or events.

**Examples:**

```bash
sort ips.txt
```

Save sorted output to a file:

```bash
sort ips.txt > sorted_ips.txt
```

---

### **4. `clear`**

**Purpose:** Clears the terminal screen for better visibility.

**Example:**

```bash
clear
```

---

### **5. `exit`**

**Purpose:** Closes the terminal session or exits a shell.

**Example:**

```bash
exit
```

---

### **6. `whoami`**

**Purpose:** Displays the currently logged-in user. Useful for privilege verification during investigations.

**Example:**

```bash
whoami
```

Redirect output to a file:

```bash
whoami > user.txt
```

---

### **7. `man`**

**Purpose:** Opens the manual pages for Linux commands. Essential for learning command options and flags.

**Example:**

```bash
man wc
```

---

### **8. `touch`**

**Purpose:** Creates an empty file or updates a file's timestamp. Often used to quickly create log or config files.

**Example:**

```bash
touch logs.txt
```

---

### **9. `less`**

**Purpose:** Views file content page by page. Preferred for large log files.

**Example:**

```bash
less access.log
```

---

### **10. Output Redirection (`>` and `>>`)**

**Purpose:** Redirects command output into files.

* `>` overwrites existing content
* `>>` appends to existing content

**Examples:**

```bash
echo "Test log" > logs.txt
```

```bash
echo "New alert detected" >> logs.txt
```

---

### **11. `cat`**

**Purpose:** Displays the contents of a file. Best for small files.

**Example:**

```bash
cat logs.txt
```

---

### **12. `head`**

**Purpose:** Displays the first lines of a file. Useful for checking log headers.

**Example:**

```bash
head -n 5 access.log
```

---

### **13. `tail`**

**Purpose:** Displays the last lines of a file. Very important in SOC work for monitoring recent events.

**Examples:**

```bash
tail -n 10 access.log
```

Append last 5 log entries to another file:

```bash
tail -n 5 access.log >> logs.txt
```

## 🎯 Why This Matters for SOC & Network Security

These commands form the foundation for:

* Linux log analysis
* Incident investigation
* System monitoring
* Security automation and scripting

Mastery of these tools enables efficient navigation of Linux systems commonly used in SOC environments, SIEM backends, servers, and security appliances.
