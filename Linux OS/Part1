## Linux Command-Line Fundamentals

Overview
This project documents my practical learning of Linux command-line fundamentals, with a focus on file system navigation and basic file management.
These skills form a core foundation for SOC Analysts and Network Security Analysts, as Linux is widely used in servers, security tools, and log management systems.
All commands were practiced hands-on in a Linux environment to build confidence and accuracy.

## File System Navigation & Management

** pwd — Print Working Directory **
The pwd command displays the absolute path of the current working directory.
Purpose:
Confirms the exact location within the file system
Helps prevent running commands in the wrong directory
cd — Change Directory
The cd command is used to move between directories within the Linux file system.
Examples include using cd logs to enter a directory, cd .. to move one level up to the parent directory, and cd without arguments to return to the home directory.
Key understanding:
cd without arguments moves to the home directory
cd .. moves one directory level up
ls — List Directory Contents
The ls command displays files and directories within a specified location.
Common options include ls -l for a detailed view showing permissions, ownership, file size, and timestamps, and ls -a for displaying hidden files.
Security relevance:
Useful for checking file ownership and permissions
Commonly used when inspecting system and log directories
touch — Create Files
The touch command creates empty files or updates timestamps of existing files, such as using touch alert.txt to create a new file.
Use case:
Creating test files or configuration placeholders
rm — Remove Files and Directories
The rm command deletes files and directories from the system.
For example, rm test.log removes a file, while rm -r test recursively removes a directory and its contents.
Important notes:
Files removed using rm are permanently deleted
Recursive deletion is required for directories
Extra caution is necessary when using administrative privileges
mv — Move or Rename Files
The mv command is used to move files between directories or rename them.
Examples include mv old.txt new.txt to rename a file and mv alerts.log /var/log/ to move a file into a system log directory.
Security context:
Frequently used when organizing log files
System directories may require elevated permissions
⚠️ Command Safety Awareness
I developed awareness of potentially destructive commands such as rm *.
Key understanding:
Removes all non-hidden files in the current directory
Does not remove directories unless used with the recursive option
Reinforces the importance of verifying the working directory before execution
🧠 Skills Developed
Confident navigation of Linux file systems
Safe creation, deletion, movement, and renaming of files
Basic understanding of directory structures and permissions
Improved command-line accuracy and caution
🔐 Relevance to Cybersecurity & SOC Roles
These Linux fundamentals are essential for:
Navigating log directories such as /var/log
Running and managing Linux-based security tools
Supporting incident investigation and response workflows
Building a strong foundation for advanced security operations
