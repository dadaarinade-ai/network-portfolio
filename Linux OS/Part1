## Linux Command-Line Fundamentals

Overview
This project documents my practical learning of Linux command-line fundamentals, with a focus on file system navigation and basic file management.
These skills form a core foundation for SOC Analysts and Network Security Analysts, as Linux is widely used in servers, security tools, and log management systems.
All commands were practiced hands-on in a Linux environment to build confidence and accuracy.

## File System Navigation & Management

### **1. pwd — Print Working Directory**
The pwd command displays the absolute path of the current working directory.
Purpose:
Confirms the exact location within the file system
Helps prevent running commands in the wrong directory
Example:
pwd


### **2. cd — Change Directory**
The cd command is used to move between directories within the Linux file system.
Examples:
cd dirl (logs to enter a directory)
cd .. (to move one level up to the parent directory)
cd (without arguments to return to the home directory)
cd ~ ( to go home)
cd / ( to the root)

### **3. ls — List Directory Contents**
The ls command displays files and directories within a specified location.
Examples
ls folder(list out directories or file in 'folder' in short form)
ls -l (for a detailed view showing permissions, ownership, file size, and timestamps)
ls -a (for displaying hidden files.)
ls -lh (human readable files)

Security relevance:
Useful for checking file ownership and permissions
Commonly used when inspecting system and log directories

### **4. touch — Create Files**
The touch command creates empty files or updates timestamps of existing files, such as using touch alert.txt to create a new file.
Example:
touch test.txt ( creates empty files named test.txt)

### **5. rm — Remove Files and Directories**
The rm command deletes files and directories from the system.  
Example:
rm test.log (removes a file named 'test.log') 
rm -r test (recursively removes a directory named 'text' and its contents).
rm -rf test( forcefully delete 'test')
rm -v test ( shows details in what is being removed in 'test')
rm -i test (it is interactive asking y/n)
rmdir work ( remove empty directory named 'work')

Important notes:
Files removed using rm are permanently deleted
Recursive deletion is required for directories
Extra caution is necessary when using administrative privileges

### **6. mv — Move or Rename Files**
The mv command is used to move files between directories or rename them.
Examples: 
mv old.txt new.txt (to rename a file)
mv alerts.log /var/log/ (to move a file into a system log directory)

Security context:
Frequently used when organizing log files
System directories may require elevated permissions

### **7. mkdir - Make Directory**
The command mkdir creates new directory in filesystem.
Example:
mkdir newfolder (creates folder named 'newfolder')
mkdir -p folder/folder1 (created nested folders)


## **8. cp- Copying**
This command copies files or directories from one location to another 
Example:
cp source.txt destination ( copies source.txt into destination)
cp -r folder folder_backup ( copies folder content into folder_backup)

## Command Safety Awareness
I developed awareness of potentially destructive commands such as rm *.

### Skills Developed
Confident navigation of Linux file systems
Safe creation, deletion, movement, and renaming of files
Basic understanding of directory structures and permissions
Improved command-line accuracy and caution

### Relevance to Cybersecurity & SOC Roles
These Linux fundamentals are essential for:
Navigating log directories such as /var/log
Running and managing Linux-based security tools
Supporting incident investigation and response workflows
Building a strong foundation for advanced security operations
