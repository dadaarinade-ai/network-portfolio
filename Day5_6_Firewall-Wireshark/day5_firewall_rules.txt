Day 5 — Firewall Rules and Port Security Configuration
------------------------------------------------------

**Objective:** Strengthen system security by blocking common vulnerable ports and verifying results.

**Blocked Ports:**
1. TCP Port 135 — Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
2. TCP Port 139 — NetBIOS Session Service
3. TCP Port 445 — SMB (Server Message Block)

**Commands Executed:**

# View current firewall status
netsh advfirewall show allprofiles

# Turn on firewall for all profiles
netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state on

# Block inbound and outbound connections on key ports
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Block RPC (135)" dir=in action=block protocol=TCP localport=135
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Block RPC (135) Out" dir=out action=block protocol=TCP remoteport=135

netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Block NetBIOS (139)" dir=in action=block protocol=TCP localport=139
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Block NetBIOS (139) Out" dir=out action=block protocol=TCP remoteport=139

netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Block SMB (445)" dir=in action=block protocol=TCP localport=445
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Block SMB (445) Out" dir=out action=block protocol=TCP remoteport=445

# Verify active block rules
netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all | findstr "Block"

**Nmap Verification:**
Before blocking:
135/tcp open  msrpc
139/tcp open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp open  microsoft-ds

After blocking (expected):
All blocked ports should show as "filtered" or "closed".

**Firewall Policy Summary:**
- All profiles (Domain, Private, Public) set to “BlockInbound, AllowOutbound”
- Logging enabled for dropped packets
- Inbound TCP ports 135, 139, and 445 successfully blocked

**Outcome:**
Successfully configured and verified Windows Defender Firewall to block SMB, NetBIOS, and RPC traffic using PowerShell and Nmap testing.
