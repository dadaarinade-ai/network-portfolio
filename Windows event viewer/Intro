Windows Events (intro Summary)

Windows Events are records created by the Windows operating system to document important activities on a computer.
Each record shows what happened, when it happened, and who was involved.

Windows stores these records in event logs, which can be viewed using Windows Event Viewer.

Windows Event Viewer

Windows Event Viewer is a built-in tool used to view and analyze event logs.
It helps administrators and security analysts monitor system activity, troubleshoot issues, and detect suspicious behavior.

---

System Log

Records events generated by the Windows operating system

Examples: system startup, shutdown, service failures



---

Security Log

Examples: logins, failed logins, account changes

Most important log for SOC and security monitoring

Requires security auditing to be enabled

Structure of a Windows Event

Each Windows Event contains:

Event ID – Identifies the specific activity that occurred

Level – Indicates severity (Information, Warning, Error, Critical)

Source – Component or service that generated the event

Time and Date – When the event occurred

User Account – Account responsible for the action

Event Details – Additional context such as IP address, process name, and logon type

Windows Security Auditing

Security auditing controls what activities Windows logs.
Without auditing enabled, many important security events will not be recorded.

Common audited activities include:

Logon and logoff events

Account management

Process creation

File and object access

Why Windows Events Matter in SOC

Windows Events provide visibility into system and user activity.
They allow SOC analysts to investigate incidents and detect threats by answering:

Who accessed the system?

How did they access it?

What actions were performed?

When did it happen?
