Splunk Security Lab Setup and Installed Components

Overview

This project documents the installation and configuration of Splunk Enterprise and its essential supporting components to create a functional Security Operations Center (SOC)–ready log analysis environment.
The goal of this setup is to enable effective log collection, monitoring, and basic security analysis, aligned with the responsibilities of a SOC Level 1 Analyst.

The environment was deployed on a Linux-based system (Parrot OS in a virtual machine) and configured to ingest logs from both Linux and Windows systems, which reflects real enterprise security monitoring scenarios.

1. Splunk Enterprise Installation

Splunk Enterprise was installed as the core Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform.

Purpose

- Centralized log collection and storage
- Event searching and correlation
- Alerting and basic threat detection
- Security monitoring and investigation

Key Features Enabled

- Web interface for log analysis
- Indexing of incoming security events
- Support for add-ons and forwarders
- Listening service for log ingestion on port 9997

---

2. Required Linux System Utilities

Before and after installing Splunk, essential Linux utilities were installed to support Splunk’s operation and maintenance.

Installed Utilities

- wget / curl – Used to download Splunk packages and add-ons
- tar / unzip – Used to extract Splunk and add-on files
- net-tools – Used to verify network ports and connectivity
- system update tools – Ensured system stability and compatibility

Importance

These tools are necessary for:

- Managing Splunk packages
- Verifying that Splunk services and ports are running correctly
- Performing troubleshooting tasks common in SOC environments

---

3. Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux

The Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux was installed to enable native Linux log ingestion.

Logs Collected

- Authentication logs ("/var/log/auth.log")
- System logs ("/var/log/syslog")
- Process and service activity
- CPU, memory, and disk usage

Security Value

This add-on allows Splunk to:

- Detect failed login attempts
- Monitor privilege escalation attempts
- Identify abnormal system behavior
- Provide visibility into Linux host activity

This is critical because Linux servers are widely used in enterprise environments and cloud infrastructure.

4. Splunk Add-on for Windows

The Splunk Add-on for Windows was installed to support Windows event log ingestion.

Logs Supported

- Security Event Logs
- System Event Logs
- Application Logs
- PowerShell activity
- Account logon and logoff events

Security Value

This add-on enables:

- Detection of brute-force login attempts
- Monitoring of suspicious PowerShell usage
- Visibility into user and system activity on Windows machines

Although Splunk runs on Linux, monitoring Windows endpoints is a core SOC responsibility, making this add-on essential.

---

5. Splunk Universal Forwarder

The Splunk Universal Forwarder was installed to enable log forwarding from endpoint systems to the Splunk server.

Purpose

- Secure and efficient log transmission
- Lightweight agent for endpoints
- Real-time forwarding of logs

Configuration

- Forwarder configured to send logs to the Splunk server on port 9997
- Receiving port enabled on the Splunk server
- Forwarder tested to confirm successful log ingestion

Importance

In real SOC environments:

- Logs are not generated on the SIEM itself
- Forwarders are used to collect logs from multiple systems
- Understanding forwarders is a key SOC analyst skill

---

6. Network and Traffic Analysis Tools

Additional tools were installed to generate and analyze network-related data that can be ingested into Splunk.

Installed Tools

- tcpdump – Captures network traffic for analysis
- Wireshark – Deep packet inspection and PCAP analysis
- Nmap – Network scanning and service discovery

Security Value

These tools allow:

- Generation of realistic security data
- Analysis of suspicious network activity
- Correlation of network behavior with logs inside Splunk

---

7. Log Receiving and Data Ingestion Configuration

Splunk was configured to actively receive logs from external systems.

Key Configuration

- Enabled Splunk listening service on port 9997
- Verified data ingestion from Linux and Windows sources
- Confirmed logs are searchable through the Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL)

This step ensures Splunk functions as a centralized SIEM, not just a standalone application.

---

8. Outcome and Skills Demonstrated

Through this setup, the following SOC-relevant skills were demonstrated:

- Installing and configuring Splunk Enterprise
- Managing Splunk add-ons for Linux and Windows
- Setting up and using Universal Forwarders
- Understanding log sources and event ingestion
- Performing basic security log analysis
- Preparing a SIEM environment aligned with SOC Level 1 responsibilities

---

Conclusion

This Splunk setup provides a solid, realistic foundation for SOC Level 1 operations.
Rather than installing unnecessary tools, the focus was placed on core components required for effective log ingestion, monitoring, and investigation.

This environment reflects how Splunk is used in real-world SOC teams and serves as a practical, job-ready security lab for continuous learning and improvement.
